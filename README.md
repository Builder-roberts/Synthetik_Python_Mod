# Synthetik_Python_Mod
A save editor tool for the game Synthetik written in python.

# Version 2.4:
### NEW: changing the values next to the items/modules/whatever in your loadout will now change their power! - Manual editing, essentially.
### NEW: Menubar! specifically File, Power, Misc, and Help.
### NEW: File: If you want to edit some other Synthetik (S1) Save file, simply open it!
### NEW: Power: OPauto is now here! additionally, Quick 1.6x makes everything 1.6, the normal daily max, no need to use Auto Module Edit!
### NEW: Help: About page, will mention people who helped make this project work in the future! Not Working: Gives some general advice and asks you to @ me on discord.
### ALERT: If you want to help me make this code better, feel totally free to @Mason on discord, and/or just fork this project.

## -Now, i gotta tell you, this is some thrown together, dumb as frick code written in python. there's probably bugs.
## -However, the largest bug probable is the deletion of your current day's save file. There are two backups in the same folder already in the game, you can just copy and paste.
## I used (https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-easily-convert-a-python-script-to-an-executable-file-exe-4966e253c7e9) to generate the exe file from my code. thank you to Caesar_Salad on discord for showing me that it worked without downloading python!
## Thank you to Tactu on discord for general coding advice! (if you're reading this, maybe do something to help, like you said you wanted to, tactu)

# Future Updates:
## Transfering all of version 2.1 to GUI, rather than the current terminal
- in progress, currently have Auto, OPauto, and Manual. Next is Itemspawn. 
### Gui update: the screenshot shows my current progress on making a GUI!
