Open the save file directly

## -now, i gotta tell you, this is some thrown together, dumb as frick code written in python. there's probably bugs, and I suggest using "opensave" as soon as possible.
## -However, the largest bug probable is the deletion of your current day's save file. there is a backup in the same folder already in the game, you can just copy and paste.
## -The help command does not mention all commands. specifically, OPauto, and Spawnauto. will be fixed as soon as I get around to updating the help command.
## -DO tell me in a comment if the exe file works? I used (https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-easily-convert-a-python-script-to-an-executable-file-exe-4966e253c7e9) to generate the exe file from my code and I have no idea if it works without downloading python?

# Future Updates:
## -Loadout editng - most proabably in the next update! wooo!
## -GUI! actual images! not using the terminal! woooo! - far flung future with Tkinter.

### Gui update: the screenshot shows my current progress on making a GUI!
