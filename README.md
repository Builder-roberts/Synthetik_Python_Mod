# Synthetik_Python_Mod
A save editor tool for the game Synthetik written in python.

# Version 2.3:
### LoadoutGUI.exe. actual gui for editing your loadout. + LoadoutGUI.py
### NEW! OPauto - changes the power level of each module to over powered levels!(YMMV) - Now in LoadoutGUI.exe!
### NEW! Auto Module Edit - changes the power level of every module to a user-specified level!
### ALERT: changing the values next to the items in your loadout will do nothing. only Auto Module Edit and OPauto do anything to change power levels.
### ALERT: If, for some reason, nothing is working, reopen Synthetik & LoadoutGUI and close it. Synthetik's Save file is very robust.

## -Now, i gotta tell you, this is some thrown together, dumb as frick code written in python. there's probably bugs.
## -However, the largest bug probable is the deletion of your current day's save file. There are two backups in the same folder already in the game, you can just copy and paste.
## -The help command does not mention all commands. specifically, OPauto, and Spawnauto. will be fixed as soon as I get around to updating the help command.
## I used (https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-easily-convert-a-python-script-to-an-executable-file-exe-4966e253c7e9) to generate the exe file from my code. thank you to Caesar_Salad on discord for showing me that it worked without downloading python!
## Thank you to Tactu on discord for general coding advice! (if you're reading this, maybe do something to help, like you said you wanted to, tactu)

# Future Updates:
## Transfering all of version 2.1 to GUI, rather than the current terminal
- in progress, currently have Auto and OPauto coverted. Next is Manual.
### Gui update: the screenshot shows my current progress on making a GUI!
