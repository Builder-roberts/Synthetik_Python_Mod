# Synthetik_Python_Mod
A save editor tool for the game Synthetik written in python.

# Version 2.5:
### Changing the values next to the items/modules/whatever in your loadout will now change their power! - Manual editing, essentially.
### Menubar! specifically File, Power, Misc, and Help.
### File: If you want to edit some other Synthetik (S1) Save file, simply open it!
### Misc: Max Data and Daily Run reset: what they say they do.
### Power: OPauto is now here! additionally, Quick 1.6x makes everything 1.6, the normal daily max, no need to use Auto Module Edit!
### Help: About page, will mention people who helped make this project work in the future! Not Working: Gives some general advice and asks you to @ me on discord.
### New! Spawn: Item and Weapon Spawn make spawn rates for token weapons higher, and everything else lower. The resets set the spawn possibility of every item/weapon back to 0.
### ALERT: Reset Item Spawn allows Armageddon shard to spawn when it shouldn't. If someone can tell me what the id for armageddon shard is, that can be fixed. until then, if you reset, just play until you get armageddon shard then quit back to the main menu.
### ALERT: If you want to help me make this code better, feel totally free to @Mason on discord, and/or just fork this project.

## -Now, i gotta tell you, this is some thrown together, dumb as frick code written in python. there's probably bugs.
## -However, the largest bug probable is the deletion of your current day's save file. There are two backups in the same folder already in the game, you can just copy and paste.
## I used (https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-easily-convert-a-python-script-to-an-executable-file-exe-4966e253c7e9) to generate the exe file from my code. thank you to Caesar_Salad on discord for showing me that it worked without downloading python!
## Thank you to Tactu on discord for general coding advice! (if you're reading this, maybe do something to help, like you said you wanted to, tactu)

# Future Updates:
## Transfering all of version 2.1 (Editfunc.exe) to GUI, rather than the current terminal
- in progress, currently have Auto, OPauto, Item/Weaponspawn, and Manual. Next is other misc items, and then we're probably done till someone gives me something more to do with it.
### Gui update: the screenshot shows my current progress on making a GUI!
## Also, I've got the code written for automatically regressing research upgrades, i'm just not ready to release the next version. Give me more ideas so i actually feel comfortable putting it out as an update!
